"Game Title" by "Justin Mullins, Scott Bettinger, Eric Hebert, and Your Names"


When play begins:
say "For many years your people have been made to suffer under the rule of King Titus. Though he was once a kind, merciful king, he has since started a great purge of those who practice magic. He has become convinced that all things magical are evil and magic in this word is all but extinct. Yet you were born with this gift...this burden. For the wrong person to see you use magic would mean certain death. You have not yet come to realize the purpose of these powers but in time your power will grow and so will your understanding of how to use it. Your destiny awaits...".


The Outer Village is a room. "You wake suddenly.  You feel a chill run down your spine as a shadowy figure walks over to you."
